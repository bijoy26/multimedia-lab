## Experiment-2 : Designing of a custom font style and typeface of অ  and ক (Sans Regular)

### Requirements
- Adobe Illustrator (Reference design)
- Fontforge Tool (font design)


- Draw two characters অ and ক on white paper, keeping in mind of the slant, font style and typeface
- Make a draft reference design using 'Paint 3D' and export it in _SVG format_
- Configure **FontForge** to force encode **ISO 10464-1 (unicode,BMP)**
- Import both of the SVG images 
- Adjust and tweak the design as needed
- Export the typeface in **sfd format**

### Steps
- First, I drew two characters অ and ক  on white paper, keeping in mind of the slant, font style and typeface. My preference was going with 'Sans' typeface with 'regular' style without any bold or underline.
- I made a draft reference design using **Paint 3D** and exported it in _SVG format_.
- Then I launched **FontForge Tool**, configured it to force encode **ISO 10464-1 (unicode,BMP)** and imported both of the SVG images for each character. 
- After that, I adjusted and tweaked the design as needed
- Finally, I exported the typeface in **sfd format**
